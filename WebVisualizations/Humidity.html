        <p>Based on the scatter plot above, you can see that shockingly there were more locations with higher humidity levels above the equator. Unaware of the humidity levels in the winter months, it was interesting to see the wide spectrum of high humidity north of the equator. I was aware that it was very humid around the equator, but after some research of my own it was interesting to learn humidity levels were significantly higher in the winter months than expected which could explain the trend above.</p>
