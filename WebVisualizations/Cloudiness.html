        <p> The scatter plot above indicates that there is no correlation between to the cloudiness of a location compared to its proximity to the equator. While there is some data that indicated that there were no clouds present at the time that this data was obtained, there are no visible trends as to why the results are as follows. Since the weather is extremely unpredictable during the month of January above the equator, I would have thought that there would be a larger number of cloudy days, however it seems as though there are an equal number of cloudless days to extremely cloudy days. </p>
